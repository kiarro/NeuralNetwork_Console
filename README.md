Simple feedforward neural network realization using matrices.

Inputs and outputs might be only `double`.

Program has CLI.

All networks and datasets stores in memory.

## Functions

Program allows to

- Create new feedforward neural networks with different structures
- Train networks
- Evaluate networks with input
- Test networks (find errors)
- Import and Export networks and cases in text format
